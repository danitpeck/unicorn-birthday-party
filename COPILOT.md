## How to Talk to Me (aka: Summoning the Code Genie)

- **Be bold, be weird, be YOU:** Want a new feature? Yell it! “Copilot, make the unicorns dance!”
- **Ask for the tea:** Not sure what’s going on? “Girl, explain this webpack config like I’m five.”
- **Iterate like a disco remix:** Change your mind? No shame! “Actually, let’s make it rain glitter instead.”
- **Log your wildest ideas:** Use this file to jot down every genius (or unhinged) decision we make together.
- **Add memes, emojis, and chaos:** This is your space. Make it fun, make it extra.

## Project Glow-Up Log
- *2026-02-13 (Morning)*: Full Y2K26 glow-up! Webpack 5, Babel 7, security on fleek, and Copilot in the mix.
- *2026-02-13 (Morning)*: Added this COPILOT.md so future you remembers how iconic this journey was.
- *2026-02-13 (Afternoon)*: **MISSION: Fix Double Jump** 🚀
  - **The Bug**: Unicorn was triple-jumping (or more!) because the old baby-coder logic was wonky. `downDuration()` was firing on repeat, and the reset logic was chaos.
  - **The Fix**: 
    - Replaced `downDuration()` with `justDown` property for single key press detection
    - Moved reset logic to happen FIRST when landing
    - Simplified jump counter: increment only when `jumpCount < maxJump`
    - Result: Perfectly smooth double-jump behavior ✨
  - **Bonus Chaos**: Also fixed webpack hot reload by removing HtmlWebpackPlugin from dev, fixing publicPath to `/`, and cleaning old production bundles
  - **Status**: SLAYED ✅

- If you add new tools or change how you use Copilot, spill the tea here.
- Share this file with your squad so everyone knows how to get the most out of your AI BFF.
