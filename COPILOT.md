## How to Talk to Me (aka: Summoning the Code Genie)

- **Be bold, be weird, be YOU:** Want a new feature? Yell it! “Copilot, make the unicorns dance!”
- **Ask for the tea:** Not sure what’s going on? “Girl, explain this webpack config like I’m five.”
- **Iterate like a disco remix:** Change your mind? No shame! “Actually, let’s make it rain glitter instead.”
- **Log your wildest ideas:** Use this file to jot down every genius (or unhinged) decision we make together.
- **Add memes, emojis, and chaos:** This is your space. Make it fun, make it extra.
